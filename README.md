🎓 Student Exam Score Prediction
Project Overview: The objective of this project is to predict student academic performance by analyzing various academic and socio-economic factors, such as study hours, teacher quality, and parental involvement.

🛠️ Key Contributions:

Data Cleaning: Handled missing values by using Mode Imputation, ensuring a complete and robust dataset for analysis.

Feature Engineering (Smart Encoding): Converted categorical variables (e.g., Low, Medium, High) into numerical values (1, 2, 3) using Ordinal Mapping to help the model understand the inherent ranking.

Predictive Modeling: Implemented a Linear Regression algorithm to estimate final exam scores based on the input features.

📊 Model Performance:

R2 Score: 0.77 – This indicates that the model explains 77% of the variance in the exam scores.

Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 0.44 – On average, the model's predictions deviate by only 0.44 marks from the actual scores, demonstrating high precision.
